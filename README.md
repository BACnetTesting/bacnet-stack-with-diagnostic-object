# BACnet Diagnostic Object, Properties and Services

This repo is available for review and participation for developing a BACnet Diagnostic Object.
When ready, we will be proposing to the BACnet committee that they include the new features in the standard.

This repo is a fork of Steve Karg's bacnet-stack, and is not intended to replace that, it is more of a sandpit to avoid
polluting Steve's very popular repo while we implement proof of concepts outside of the standard.

All finalized contributions here will be merged with a branch in Steve's repo, and when (if) approved, the final features will be merged with Steve's master branch. If.

There is a discussion forum: https://forum.bac-test.com/t/bacnet-diagnostic-object-properties-and-services/10
